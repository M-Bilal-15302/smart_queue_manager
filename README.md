# Smart Queue Manager
Smart Queue Manager is a mobile-based system designed to simplify queue management in places like clinics, offices, and service centers. Instead of waiting in long lines, users can book tokens remotely, get real-time updates, and receive notifications when itâ€™s their turn. The system also includes an admin panel for staff to manage queues efficiently, reducing crowding and saving valuable time for both users and service providers.
